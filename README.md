Overall I thought it was a good program, with some classes more helpful than others. 
The courses weren't so easy that you could get by without doing some work but were easy 
enough that even I (the 2017 release of me no less!) could complete them. 

The coverage was Microsoft-heavy (who'd a thunk!?) but with Microsoft's 
recent embracement of Open-Source means that many of the "Microsoft" products 
are just managed versions of Open-Source Projects.

### Introduction to Data Science
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-data-science 

https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Data-Science-Orientation 

This course was extremely basic and served as an introduction to the subject and 
an overview of the the MPP Data Science Track. 


### Query Relational Data with Transact-SQL
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT201x+5T2016/course/ 

https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/QueryingT-SQL 

A great course on T-SQL (the kind of SQL that SQL-Server uses). Takes the user 
from knowing nothing about SQL to doing all kinds of advanced queries!


### Analyze and Visualize Data with Excel
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT206x+5T2016/course/ 

https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Analyzing-Visualizing-Data-Excel 

This course is a great overview of Excel. Excel is not my favorite data-science tool but 
sets the bar for spreadsheet applications. Excel has some pretty convenient features if you
are working on a small data-set. 


### Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics 
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+DS101X+1T2016/course/ 

In this release of the MPP Data Science track a class from Columbia University was used to 
cover basic statistics.
